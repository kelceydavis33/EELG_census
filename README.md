# EELG_census

This repository doccuments the code used to generate the data sample and plots from A Census from JWST of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies Spanning the Epoch of Reionization in CEERS  (Davis 2023) available at:

All code is available in the EELG_census.ipynb jupyter notebook


This work explored the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) legacy deep field observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We identified extreme emission lines through a pureply photometric search in the filters of JWST, utilizing the below roadmap:

We will explore the properties of these EELGs in future work.
